rules_engine
============

This is a sample project I've used in the past to evaluate candidates for technical interviews.  We start with a failing test (in this case, spec/rules_engine_spec.rb) and ping-pong pair program to make it pass.  In the process, we build a simple rules engine with a primitive dsl.

The rules engine is a good way to evaluate a candidate for basic Ruby skills, testing skills, object orientation, and design patterns.
